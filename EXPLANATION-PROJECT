This project is basically to use Java to organize a hospital's structure. I made it using a step-down approach, where big parts contain smaller parts.
How I Built It
The Structure:Firstly , I created five main classes that are Hospital, Department, Room, MedicalEquipment, and Part.Here hospital class act as main or top level entity that hold everything together then
The Links: I used ArrayLists so that one Hospital can hold many Departments, and one piece of Equipment can hold many Parts.afterwards
The Logic of doing that is simple because Most connections are Composition. This means if a Department is removed, its Rooms are removed too, because a Room cannot exist without a Department.
There is a  Exception here  that if Medical Equipment is connected via Aggregation. This is because an MRI machine can be moved to a different department or sold; it doesn't "die" just because one department closes.
THE main goal of this project is to build a HOSPITAL Management System using java. AND MAKE real world RELATIONSHIP between different parts of medical facility using OOP.
